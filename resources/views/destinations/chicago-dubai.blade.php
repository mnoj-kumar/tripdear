                    <li>It is important to know the basic layout of where you are traveling to really soak up the culture and have a great time without offending anyone. Dubai is primarily a Muslim country and has set rules and customs. Keep your shoulders and knees covered before entering any public place.</li>

                    <li>Make sure you buy and consume alcohol at licensed bars and clubs only.</li>
                    <li>Public display of affection such as hugging is considered impolite and will not make a good impression. </li>
                    <li>Flight from Chicago to Dubai is a long flight and can induce serious jet lag. Do not let the jet lag get in your way of enjoying Dubai by trying to get sleep on the plane. Mold your body to work at the destination time.</li>
