                    <p>The following general terms and conditions apply, however regional circumstances and regulations, contractual obligations to suppliers, and matters relating to location, product type and supply logistics may cause these to be varied slightly for specific products, or specific destinations. These amendments and alterations are shown in the Terms And Conditions sections of each web site, and should be read in conjunction with the Terms And Conditions shown below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Travel arrangements and prices detailed on our web sites are provided and coordinated by Tripdear.com</li>
                        <li>Tripdear has taken due care and responsibility to verify and check all information on our web sites as at the time of compilation, however, as this information is supplied by the relevant accommodation & tour/cruise operators in our brochures, it accepts no responsibility for any inaccuracy or misdescription contained in the publications.</li>

                        <li>Tripdear does not accept any liability of whatever nature for the acts, omissions or default, whether negligent or otherwise, of those service providers in connections with your convention pursuant to a contract between them and yourselves and over whom we have no direct control.

                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="mb-2">Terms and Conditions of Booking</h2>
                    <p><b>Quotes, Rates and Price Variations:</b> Our quotation system accesses both live pricing and static pricing depending upon the supplier. It is not uncommon for suppliers (e.g. Airlines, Cruise Liners and Hotels) to sell out, alter or withdraw prices including advertised special rates. If prices, rates or inclusions vary from your quotation or from an advertised price, we will advise you of any change prior to your booking request and any transaction being processed. If you do not wish to proceed with the booking at the new price, you may cancel the booking request at no cost to you. Once your booking has been confirmed and payment received, any new specials released cannot be applied to existing bookings. Prior to full and final payment being received, we reserve the right to vary prices and rates in the event of changes in exchange rates or price rises made by wholesalers or other suppliers. If the cost of any service increases due to exchange rate fluctuations, price increases, tax changes or any other reason, you are required to pay the increase when notified by us or you may cancel the booking. We are not liable in any way if any increase occurs due to exchange rate fluctuations, taxes or supplier notifications. Rates quoted are appropriate to the particular product at the time of quoting and these rates may change prior to the travel date. All prices are subject to availability and can be withdrawn or varied without notice.</p>

                    <p><b>Bookings - Deposits & Final Payments:</b> Bookings travelling more than 45 days out will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit based on the supplier's terms at the time of confirmation with the balance owing payable 45 days prior to travel (the “due date”). The amount will vary per booking depending on the supplier's requirements. Prior to the due date, the balance owing may be paid by one of our payment options. Final Payments paid using Credit Card or PayPal will be subject to Merchant Fees. In some cases, our suppliers require payment more than 45 days prior to travel. If this is the case you will be notified at time of booking. We will email you a final payment reminder. Travel vouchers and booking confirmations cannot be issued until final payment is received. If you fail to pay by the due date we reserve the right to automatically charge the credit card provided to complete the final payment. Any booking not paid in full by the due date is subject to automatic cancellation without further notification. Any deposit paid will be forfeited or, at your request, it may be used as a payment towards an alternative booking. Deposit conditions for certain accommodation and tour products may vary and we will advise you of these conditions and request your consent prior to proceeding with the booking. Bookings over Christmas and New Year’s (Festive Season) may require a non-refundable deposit of between AU$300 & AU$500, and final payment 60 days prior, as this it non refundable under any circumstances. We highly recommend you purchase travel insurance.</p>
